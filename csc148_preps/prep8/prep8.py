"""Prep 8 Synthesize

=== CSC148 Winter 2019 ===
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module Description ===
Your task in this prep is to implement each of the unimplemented Tree methods
in this file.
The starter code has a recursive template that treats both the "empty tree"
and the "size-one" tree as base cases.  You may not need both of these base
cases -- it depends on the method you are writing.  If you can, collapse down
to just one base case.
